# Mammogram_prediction
Data from "mammographic masses" public dataset from the UCI repository (source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)\n
A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. If we can build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning, it could improve a lot of lives\n
Machine learning models are deployed to and scored on their accuracy for correctly predicting whether a mammogram mass is malignant or benign,
